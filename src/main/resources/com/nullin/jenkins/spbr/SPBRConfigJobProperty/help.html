    Customize the parameters use for categorization of builds on the Simple Parameteried Builds Report.
    Both properties take a comma separate list of values. Configure <b>Includes</b> to give a list of properties
    that should be used in the reports. Configure <b>Excludes</b> to give a list of properties that should
    be excluded from the list. If both are specified, only <b>Includes</b> are considered. Note that these settings
    have no effect unless this build is parameterized.
